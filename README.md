## üîç Overview

RepRadar is an AI-powered sales call analysis tool that helps sales teams improve their performance by automatically analyzing sales call recordings. Leveraging Mistral's cutting-edge Voxtral model for audio processing, RepRadar transcribes sales calls, segments them into different stages, identifies objections and competitor mentions, scores rep performance, and provides actionable coaching recommendations.

## üß† How It Works

RepRadar uses Mistral's Voxtral model, which represents a significant advancement in audio processing and understanding. The app follows this workflow:

1. **Audio Input**: Upload MP3/WAV audio files or provide audio URLs
2. **Transcription**: The Voxtral API transcribes audio with timestamps
3. **Segmentation**: Segments are analyzed and grouped into call stages
4. **Analysis**: Mistral's API extracts insights, objections, and coaching recommendations
5. **Visualization**: Results are displayed in an intuitive dashboard

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend & App Framework**: Streamlit
- **AI Processing**: Mistral AI's Voxtral model
- **Data Visualization**: Plotly, Pandas
- **API Integration**: Requests, Python-dotenv
- **Audio Processing**: Pydub

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Mistral API key (get one from [Mistral AI Console](https://console.mistral.ai/))

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AIAnytime/Voxtral-Streamlit-App
   cd Voxtral-Streamlit-App
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Mistral API key (optional):
   ```
   MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
   Note: You can also provide your API key directly through the app interface.

4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

## üíª Usage

1. Open the app in your browser (typically at http://localhost:8501)
2. Enter your Mistral API key in the API Configuration section (or use the one in your .env file)
3. Upload an audio file or provide a URL to an audio file of a sales call
4. Click "Analyze Call" to process the audio
5. Explore the results across five tabs:
   - **Transcript**: View the full call transcript with timestamps
   - **Overview**: See call metrics and timeline visualization
   - **Objections**: Review detected customer objections and competitor mentions
   - **Rep Performance**: Analyze rep performance scores and talk time distribution
   - **Coaching**: Get AI-generated coaching tips and example responses

## üéõÔ∏è API Configuration

RepRadar requires a Mistral API key to function. You have two options:

1. **Environment Variable**: Add your key to a `.env` file
2. **In-App Entry**: Provide your key directly in the app's API Configuration section

The app will prioritize the key entered through the UI over the environment variable.
